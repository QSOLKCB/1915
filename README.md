**Slade, T. (2025). _The Cosmological Consistency Act of 1915: A Formal Governance Analysis (Feynman-Protected Edition)._**

The paper presents a structured, policy-style analysis of the fictional *Cosmological Consistency Act of 1915*. By treating the Act as if it were a genuine piece of scientific regulation, the work uses the language of governance, compliance, and legislative structure to critique the cultural, institutional, and methodological dynamics that shape modern theoretical cosmology.

The project combines:
- Science-governance analysis  
- Satirical reconstruction of a regulatory framework  
- Commentary on cosmological orthodoxy and institutional inertia  
- A formal academic presentation suitable for indexing, archiving, and citation  

The Feynman-Protected Edition includes a per-page header (“DO NOT LET FEYNMAN SEE THIS”), retained for historical and memetic completeness.

## Abstract

The *Cosmological Consistency Act of 1915* is analyzed as a mock regulatory framework governing theoretical cosmology. Through the structure of legislation—definitions, articles, compliance standards, sanctions, and historical amendments—the document critiques the cultural norms, institutional pressures, and methodological constraints embedded within modern physics. This analysis highlights how bureaucratic language and governance frameworks can be repurposed to expose issues such as paradigm lock-in, mathematical performativity, and the politics of peer review. Presented in a formal academic style, the work functions simultaneously as satire and as a commentary on the sociology of science.
